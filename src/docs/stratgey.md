Strategic Additions for Enterprise Readiness

1. Logging & Monitoring

- Use morgan for HTTP logs (dev) and winston or pino for structured logs (prod).
- Integrate with external monitoring tools: Datadog, Prometheus, or New Relic.

2. Environment Validation

- Use dotenv + joi or zod to validate required env vars at startup.

3. Graceful Shutdown

- Handle SIGINT and SIGTERM to close DB connections and stop accepting traffic.

4. Request ID & Tracing

- Add a middleware to attach a unique X-Request-ID to each request for traceability.

5. Async Error Handling

- Use a wrapper like express-async-errors or custom catchAsync(fn) to avoid try/catch clutter.

6. Security Enhancements

- Add CSRF protection (csurf) if your app handles sessions or forms.
- Sanitize inputs (express-validator, xss-clean, mongo-sanitize).
- Enforce HTTPS via middleware or reverse proxy.

7. Rate Limiting Granularity

- Separate rate limiters for public APIs, auth routes, and sensitive endpoints.

8. Versioned APIs

- Use /api/v1/... structure to support future upgrades without breaking clients.

9. Request Validation

- Validate incoming payloads with zod, joi, or express-validator.

10. Global Config & Constants

- Centralize config (e.g., config.ts) for timeouts, limits, feature flags, etc.
